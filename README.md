# StudySync_MiniProject
It is a static website which it built purely on HTML and CSS. I built this website when i was learming HTML and CSS and made this website with some basic hover effects, flex, grid and all the transformation things used in css. It can further be taken to a fully working platform but for now its a staric page no functionalities included.
